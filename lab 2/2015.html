        <h4> Why chose this?</h4>
        <p>I chose this website as I was growing up, this would be my go to for playing games. Ranging from the kingdom rush series to last stand series, I made a lot of memories here.</p>

        <h4> Analysis of the website:2015</h4>
        <p> 2015 design had some changes compared to 2010. One major is showcasing the badge of the day which highlights an achievement from a particular game. we can also see hot new games and highest rated games as a feature in this design. In terms of technicality, the banner in which they showcase the badges seems to wrapped in a container which also contains a list. This enables the banner to be scrollable.</p>
