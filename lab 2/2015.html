        <h4> Why chose this?</h4>
        <p>I chose this website as I was growing up, this would be my go to for playing games. Ranging from the kingdom rush series to last stand series, I made a lot of memories here.</p>

        <h4> Analysis of the website:2010</h4>
        <p> 2010 was a time where Kongregate really picked up a lot of gamers around the world. Albeit me starting gaming at 2011, I think 2010 deserve a remark in regards to its design and popularity. Here we can see the "OG" design that would be the face of Kongregate for many years. This design is simple and User friendly. One example of showcasing such trait would be the feature games in upon opening the website. The picture above won't show it but it has an animation that would showcase trending games. </p>
