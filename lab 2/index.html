      <h4 class="head4">Why choose this?</h4>
      <p>
        I chose this website as I was growing up, this would be my go to for
        playing games. Ranging from the kingdom rush series to last stand
        series, I made a lot of memories here. This website was launched on
        <a href=" https://blog.kongregate.com/untitled-3/"> 2006</a> by Emily
        and Jim Greer. The purpose of the platform was for anyone to upload
        games and find potential audiences.

      <h4>Analysis of the website:2010</h4>
      <p>
        2010 was a time where Kongregate really picked up a lot of gamers around
        the world. Albeit me starting gaming at 2011, I think 2010 deserve a
        remark in regards to its design and popularity. Here we can see the "OG"
        design that would be the face of Kongregate for many years. This design
        is simple and User friendly. One example of showcasing such trait would
        be the feature games in upon opening the website. The picture above
        won't show it but it has an animation that would showcase trending
        games.

      </div>
      <p>
        Here we can see some games that have been seperated by category for
        gamers to enjoy. Back then, indie games were the trend and as such, they
        usually take up a category menu. As for the technical side of the
        website, each of the category box is inside a description list tag &lt;
        dl &gt; which is then contained inside a div. we can also see that there
        is a news section which is also inside a div. Futhermore, the text
        inside is in a &lt;dd&gt; tag.
