        <h4> Why chose this?</h4>
        <p>I chose this website as I was growing up, this would be my go to for playing games. Ranging from the kingdom rush series to last stand series, I made a lot of memories here.</p>

        <h4> Analysis of the website:2015</h4>
        <p> There were no significant changes in the 2020 design. However, it is to be noted that the banner in which they showcase the badges for highlighted games is now showcasing best games of the previous year. What I can take away from the design of the website is that if your design becomes a trademark, there's no really incentive to change it. Kongregate, however, changed the color palette they were using &#40;which to me is a change I wouldn't do&#41;. </p>
