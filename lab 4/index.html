            Over the next few years, the solar energy market is likely to grow
            as the price of solar power technology goes down, installation
            methods get better, and more people become interested in distributed
            solar power generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the other hand, support and investments in other clean energy
            sources like hydro, geothermal, wind, biomass, etc. are expected to
            slow the growth of the solar energy market during the forecast
            period.

          <li>
            Nevertheless, New Zealand population growth and the rising
            electrification of heat and transport, the power demand is likely to
            rise to 70 TWh by 2050. Such a scenario, in turn, is expected to
            create vital opportunities for solar power players in the future.

      <h1>Renewables in New Zealand</h1>
      <p>
        Renewable energy in New Zealand, particularly solar energy, is
        experiencing significant growth. The key players contributing to this
        growth include Meridian Energy Ltd, JA Solar Holdings, Trina Solar
        Co., NZ Solar Ltd, and Lodestone Energy. Meridian Energy Ltd is one of
        the major players in the New Zealand solar energy market. They have
        been actively involved in the development and implementation of solar
        energy projects in the country. JA Solar Holdings and Trina Solar Co.
        are also prominent contributors to the solar energy sector in New
        Zealand. These companies play a crucial role in the production and
        supply of solar panels, which are essential for harnessing solar
        energy. NZ Solar Ltd is another key player in the renewable energy
        industry in New Zealand. They are known for their expertise in solar
        energy and have made significant contributions to the sector's growth.
        Lodestone Energy, backed by the largest solar company in New Zealand,
        has made substantial investments in solar farms in the North Island.
        With a budget of $300 million, these solar farms are expected to have
        a significant impact on the country's solar energy production. These
        key players have played a crucial role in driving the growth of the
        solar energy sector in New Zealand. Their contributions range from
        project development, supply of solar panels, and investments in solar
        farms. Their collective efforts have helped New Zealand become a
        success story for the development of renewable energy without
        government subsidies

        Solar energy is one of the renewable energies. It is made by
        converting the energy that is already in the sun.Once the sunlight
        passes through the earth's atmosphere, most of it is in the form of
        visible light and infrared radiation. Solar cell panels are used to
        convert this energy into electricity.The New Zealand solar energy
        market is segmented by end-user. By end-user, the market is segmented
        into residential, commercial and industrial (C&I), and utility. The
        New Zealand solar energy market covers the size of the market and
        forecasts for the market. For each segment, market sizing and
        forecasts have been done based on installed capacity (MW).
