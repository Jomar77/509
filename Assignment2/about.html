        <p class="text-wrapper-5">
          In the heart of Invercargill, a small slice of the Philippines has
          found its home. Our lodge and grocery store is a labor of love, a
          place where the warmth of Filipino culture mingles with the rich
          flavors of our homeland. We invite you to be a part of our journey,
          where we've been sharing a taste of the Philippines with our community
          for several years now.
        </p>
        <div class="text-wrapper-4">A Growing Legacy</div>
        <p class="text-wrapper-5">
          Over the years, our lodge and grocery store have grown and evolved,
          just like the community we serve. We've become a beloved gathering
          place for Filipinos, both as a place to stock up on familiar
          ingredients and as a hub for connecting with friends and neighbors who
          share a love for Filipino culture. At the heart of our story is our
          commitment to you, our valued customers and guests. We're not just a
          business; we're a part of your lives, sharing in your experiences, and
          being here to support you in your journey. As we look back on our time
          in Invercargill, we're excited for the future and the opportunities it
          holds to continue serving our community with the flavors of the
          Philippines and the warmth of Filipino hospitality. Thank you for
          being a part of our story, and we can't wait to see what the next
          chapter will bring. Mabuhay!
